# Analysis with AI agents

This page is a routing and reasoning guide for an AI agent that uses Scarf to analyse data.
It does not replace the workflow tutorials or define one correct analysis.
The study question, experimental design, and user instructions remain authoritative.
For an executable ingest-to-finalization example with persisted decisions and report generation,
see {doc}`tutorials/agent_workflow`.

## Scope and authority

An agent may inspect data, run documented public methods, create reversible analysis branches, and compare alternatives.
Report a supported provisional choice and label each statement as:

- a computational fact, such as which artifact or cells produced a result;
- statistical evidence, such as a mixing score or marker AUC;
- a biological interpretation, which may require study context and independent validation.

Do not convert a default, visual pattern, or single metric into biological ground truth.
State assumptions when study metadata are incomplete.
Stop rather than claim an identified treatment, disease, or batch effect when the relevant variables are perfectly confounded.

## How Scarf represents an analysis

### DataStore, selections, and artifacts

A `DataStore` contains count matrices, cell metadata, feature metadata, and persisted results.
A Boolean {term}`cell key` can define an initial cohort. Snapshot it before analysis so downstream
operations and agents consume an immutable cell-selection artifact. An immutable
{term}`feature selection` artifact selects assay features.
Analytical producers return exact {py:class}`~scarf.ArtifactRef` values and leave metadata
unchanged. Filtering returns a cell-selection artifact without changing live `I` or
deleting counts.

Persisted results are immutable {term}`artifacts <artifact>`.
Their provenance records the operation, scientific parameters, and input artifacts.
A durable {py:class}`~scarf.PipelineRun` records one complete recipe invocation and exposes frozen
views over its selections and result fields. Granular workflows retain returned artifact refs and
pass them explicitly.

### Branches and mounts

Alternative results can coexist.
Retain each granular method's returned {py:class}`~scarf.ArtifactRef` and pass that reference to the
next operation. No branch becomes a global implicit result.
See {doc}`tutorials/custom_analyses` for a complete example and {doc}`concepts/provenance` for the storage model.

Opening a mounted store with another workspace name does not create a separate analysis.
A mount records one source workspace, and reopening that target with a different workspace is rejected.
Create a separate mount target for each analysis that needs independent metadata and results.
Use artifact branches within one target when only parameters or downstream methods differ.
Mount behavior is documented in {doc}`tutorials/remote_stores`; general layout is documented in {doc}`tutorials/data_organization`.

## Start or continue safely

### Inspect the current store

Start with `snapshot = ds.summary()`.
It reports the workspace, default assay, resource budget, metadata column names, complete or
incomplete artifacts, pipeline-run counts, and completed run labels without exposing a store
location.
`active_cells` and each assay's `active_features` count the literal `I` columns.
They do not follow a historical artifact or pipeline-run selection.
Resolve and inspect feature-selection artifacts separately when evaluating a branch.
Use `snapshot.to_dict()` for a deterministic JSON-safe record.

Before choosing the next operation:

1. Identify the assays and the current default assay.
2. Inspect cell and feature metadata columns, including active selections.
3. Use `ds.pipeline.list_runs()` and run reports to identify durable recipe invocations.
4. Use `ds.list_artifacts(complete_only=True)` to find persisted alternatives.
5. Use `ds.inspect_artifact(ref)` before consuming an explicit result.
6. Use `ds.lineage(ref)` to verify upstream inputs.

`lineage.to_markdown()` and `lineage.to_mermaid()` produce compact provenance records for an analysis log.
Do not infer state by reading private Zarr paths.
Use public methods instead of mutating `ds.z`, `ds.zw`, or stored run records.

Inspect unfamiliar H5AD files with {py:func}`scarf.inspect_h5ad` before creating a reader.
This reports matrix candidates, encodings, dimensions, and suggested assays instead of relying on guessed keys.
Use the format-specific import guides for other inputs.

### Prospective execution record

Before the first mutating operation, make a short execution record containing:

- the scientific question and unit of inference;
- the cell-selection and feature-selection references, plus other input artifact references;
- the operations that will persist artifacts or export data;
- the alternatives and independent evidence that will be compared;
- the criteria for selecting a branch, preserving uncertainty, or stopping.

Update this record before changing the cohort, inputs, or decision criteria.
This prospective boundary makes unintended writes and retrospective justifications visible.
`AgentOrchestrator` persists the immutable request, effective configuration, stage attempts,
agent-report handoffs, and artifact references. The caller still owns the scientific question and
unit of inference.

### When to use the automated agent workflow

Use `analyze_rna` when the input is a supported dataset path and the caller can supply one
study-context paragraph and one study objective. The automated workflow supports one RNA assay;
other modalities may coexist in the store but are not analyzed. Automated multimodal integration
and hypothesis testing are deferred. Use the ordinary Scarf APIs for those analyses.
The orchestrator owns a fixed stage order: ingest,
Data Enrichment, Experimental Context, preprocessing planning and
execution, Parameter Tuning, feature-policy review with optional revised preprocessing and tuning,
analysis review, and analysis finalization. The model does not write exploratory code or choose
arbitrary `DataStore` calls. It selects only validated policies and candidate identifiers from
bounded evidence; executor-owned public operations create and pass exact immutable artifact
references.

`BiologicalInterpretationAgent` is a separate bounded facade for interpreting finalized cluster
and marker artifacts. It is not an automatic stage of `AgentOrchestrator`.

```python
from scarf.agent import analyze_rna

result = analyze_rna(
    "study.h5ad",
    zarr_path="study.zarr",
    model=model,
    study_context="One paragraph describing the study and analysis intent.",
    study_objective="Discover stable populations relevant to the study.",
    max_candidates=50,
)
if result.status != "completed":
    raise RuntimeError(f"{result.status}: {'; '.join(result.notes)}")

result.plot_embedding()
markers = result.get_markers()
report_path = result.report()
```

Pass `assay` when the store has multiple RNA assays. The result helpers reopen the saved
workspace read-only and use exact final artifacts. `report()` returns the existing local HTML
path or generates the missing view, without opening a browser.

The parameter screen uses granular public operations for each authorized branch rather than
invoking `ds.pipeline.run()` for every candidate. This keeps normalization, reduction, neighbours,
graph, clustering, metrics, promotion, UMAP, and marker artifacts explicit and enforces their order
through lineage. `ds.pipeline.run()` remains the fixed baseline recipe described below.

`analyze_rna` runs unattended; its `study_objective` is required. `max_candidates` limits reserved
candidate slots across the workflow. Before screening, each pass reserves every configured
alternative, including conditional candidates that may not execute. Defaults reserve 25 slots
for the baseline and another 25 if a feature-policy revision runs; the default limit of 50 admits
both passes. A smaller limit never shrinks the candidate lists. A pass larger than the remaining
budget fails before screening. This controls admission, not actual execution counts, elapsed time,
QC diagnostics, or provider usage. Use `AgentOrchestrator` with
`AutomatedWorkflowConfig` for explicit candidate lists, workspaces, and provider limits.
Its `inputPolicy="pause"` permits a running workflow to return
`needsInput`; resume only that exact workflow with `AutomatedWorkflowResumeRequest` and its
persisted question identifiers. `inputPolicy="unattended"` resolves bounded model deferrals through
registered policy and turns genuinely unresolved evidence into an explicit abstention or failure
instead of waiting for a person. It does not authorize invented metadata or unsafe batch
correction. `runConfoundedHarmonyDiagnostic=True` permits a matched diagnostic branch, but Harmony
still cannot be selected unless the design and preservation gates accept it.

The repository notebooks `notebook/agent_workflow_new.ipynb` and
`notebook/agent_workflow_new_short.ipynb` demonstrate the unattended full-cohort and sampled smoke
test configurations. The short notebook creates a deterministic library-stratified H5AD beside
the source data and labels its result as a smoke test. A completed local workflow persists its
terminal result and then creates a replaceable HTML report. `generate_agent_report()` can
regenerate that derived view without training new analysis artifacts.

Configuration compatibility is explicit: `maxCandidateEvaluations` replaces
`maxCandidateBranches`, and obsolete initial-candidate, integration, assay-count, and stability
controls are rejected. Saved workflows with the old configuration shape cannot resume or
regenerate reports in this release. Create a new workflow with explicit candidate lists; saved
analysis artifacts remain readable through ordinary Scarf artifact APIs. No records are migrated.

### When to use the pipeline

`ds.pipeline.run()` is a persistent baseline workflow.
It writes immutable artifacts and a durable run ledger, but does not change live `I` or metadata
columns. It scores enabled Leiden resolutions in the same PCA or Harmony coordinates used to
build the graph, persists the decision as `run["cluster_selection"]`, and exposes the selected
Leiden candidate ref as `run["clusters"]`. Paris remains `run["paris"]` for diagnosis. Silhouette
supplies a reproducible baseline, not validation or ground truth. The agent orchestrator is a
separate multi-metric workflow and does not replace this pipeline selection.

Use `run.cells` and `run.features` for frozen inspection. Keep presentation and storage mutation on
the datastore: `ds.plots.embedding(run=run, ...)`, `ds.get_markers(marker=run["markers"], ...)`,
and `ds.to_anndata(run=run)`. Use an immutable run label when a completed run needs a
human-readable name. Use granular methods and explicit artifact refs for alternatives outside the
fixed recipe. For example,
`ds.plots.embedding(layout=embedding_ref, color_by=cluster_ref)` consumes granular outputs without
materializing either as metadata.

## Scientific decision loop

Use the following loop for each consequential choice:

1. **Frame the question.** Decide whether the target is population discovery, technical integration, reference mapping, abundance, within-population state, differential expression, or a continuous trajectory.
2. **Establish the unit of inference.** Identify subjects, biological replicates, conditions, batches, paired measurements, and repeated measures.
   Inspect their contingency before correction or statistical comparison.
3. **Keep a baseline.** Evaluate uncorrected data before batch correction and preserve broad, pre-subclustering labels before splitting populations.
4. **Create alternatives.** Change one consequential choice at a time where practical, use explicit artifact references, and keep seeds fixed.
5. **Compare independent evidence.** Combine graph, marker, metadata, replicate, mapping, and method-specific diagnostics.
   Do not optimize one score in isolation.
6. **Decide or stop.** Select a fit-for-purpose branch when evidence is coherent.
   Preserve alternatives and report uncertainty when evidence conflicts.
   Stop when the design cannot identify the requested effect.

## Route by task

Use {doc}`reference/api` for exact public signatures and result contracts.
The pages below explain when and how to evaluate those operations.

### Import, quality control, and feature selection

- Use {doc}`tutorials/import_and_export` for supported inputs and exports.
- Use {doc}`tutorials/quality_control` to inspect modality-specific distributions and derive dataset-specific, often sample-aware selections.
- Use {doc}`tutorials/feature_selection` to compare feature sets without treating partition agreement as proof of biological usefulness.

Report retained cells by sample or condition when those columns are available.
Do not copy thresholds from another tissue or protocol without inspecting the current distributions.

### Reduction, graph construction, and clustering

- Use {doc}`tutorials/graph_construction` for granular normalization, reduction, neighbour, and graph methods.
- Use {doc}`tutorials/dimensionality_reduction` to compare dimension counts and layouts.
- Use {doc}`tutorials/clustering` to compare Leiden resolutions, Paris cuts, graph connectivity, membership strength, and marker specificity.

There is no universally optimal partition.
A defensible partition should fit the question, avoid being driven solely by technical covariates, retain replicate support, and have interpretable positive and negative evidence.
A split population should rebuild feature selection and its graph inside the subset.
Preserve the parent labels so the split remains auditable.

### Integration, mapping, and paired modalities

Start with {doc}`tutorials/dataset_merging` when compatible datasets need one joint datastore, then use {doc}`tutorials/batch_correction` only when a defensible technical covariate should be reduced.

- Merge without correction when compatible datasets need joint inspection but no technical effect has been identified.
- Compare an uncorrected graph with partial PCA or Harmony when a defensible technical covariate should be reduced.
- Use fixed-reference mapping when queries must remain comparable to one reference over time.
- Use WNN by default for modalities measured in the same cells. Use SNN only when equal graph
  support is the intended comparison. Neither method integrates independent batches.

The batch-correction workflow compares source mixing and structural preservation.
Scarf's `metric_*` methods provide evidence, not an automatic winner.
Never correct a variable that is indistinguishable from the condition of interest and then claim the condition was preserved.

### Annotation, contrasts, and differential expression

Use {doc}`tutorials/annotation` to combine marker specificity, AUC, expression fraction, and known positive and negative markers.
Identify mixed populations explicitly and retain uncertain labels.

Marker search treats cells as observations.
For condition-level inference, use {doc}`tutorials/pseudobulk_and_differential_expression` to aggregate by biological replicate and export counts to a replicate-aware statistical method.
Descriptive pseudo-replicates made by splitting the same cells are not independent biological replicates.

Separate three questions that require different evidence:

- whether population abundance changes across samples;
- whether expression changes within a defined population;
- whether the population definition itself changes.

### Pseudotime and fate mapping

Use pseudotime only when the graph and biological question support a plausible continuous process.
Source and sink labels supervise the orientation; Scarf does not discover terminal states.

- Use {doc}`tutorials/pseudotime` for source and sink scoring.
- Use {doc}`tutorials/expression_dynamics` for expression dynamics.
- Use {doc}`tutorials/fate_mapping` for multiple terminal outcomes.
- Use {doc}`tutorials/trajectory_validation` to compare boundaries, graph components, marker tests, modules, and fate-probability validity.

Compare plausible source and sink definitions when the endpoints are uncertain.
Check validity keys, graph components, terminal probabilities, and expected marker trends.
A pseudotime or fate artifact is a model-based summary, not evidence of causal lineage.

### Methods outside Scarf

Use {doc}`tutorials/custom_analyses` for block streams, graph access, custom selections, external reductions, and supported export paths.
Export when the question needs RNA velocity, scVI, peak calling, FRiP/TSS, or another method outside Scarf.
Do not write arbitrary artifact groups directly.

## Troubleshooting

Classify the problem before retrying:

- **Input or schema:** inspect the source format and verify assay, feature, and cell identifiers.
- **Run or provenance:** inspect the pipeline report, stored cell selection, feature-selection refs,
  artifact status, and lineage.
  `ArtifactResolutionError.code` distinguishes missing, incomplete, or changed selection inputs.
  Do not consume incomplete artifacts.
- **Resource or I/O:** inspect the configured memory budget, worker count, storage profile, and remote latency.
  If an RNA store fails to open, treat it as a missing or outdated count layout and rebuild or `repack_zarr` rather than retrying the analysis stage.
  See {doc}`concepts/memory_and_execution`, {doc}`concepts/benchmarks`, and {doc}`tutorials/remote_stores`.
- **Numerical or graph:** check dimensions, graph components, neighbour count, convergence, validity masks, and method-specific diagnostics.
- **Scientific ambiguity:** preserve branches, seek another independent form of evidence, narrow the claim, or report that the available design does not resolve the alternatives.

In a granular workflow, retry the lowest failed stage. A failed pipeline run is not resumable;
start a new run, which can reuse matching complete artifacts from the earlier attempt. An automated
agent workflow resumes only while it is running after `needsInput`. Failed and abandoned
orchestrations are terminal, while completed stages in a valid running workflow are checked and
reused on resume.

## Progress and deterministic comparisons

`ds.pipeline.run(..., callback=...)` emits
{py:class}`~scarf.datastore.pipeline_accessor.PipelineEvent` values when stages start, complete,
fail, or are interrupted.
Use the callback to update an external progress record; callback failures do not control the pipeline.
The durable report records stage timing, sampled process-tree RSS, and exact created or reused
artifact plans. Granular analytical methods return artifact references.

When comparing branches, retain the same cells, features, neighbour settings, and seeds unless one is the variable being tested.
Record every deliberate difference.
A layout can vary in orientation or spacing without representing different biology.

## Analysis handoff

A useful handoff reports:

- the scientific question and unit of inference;
- the store workspace, exact cell selection, resolved feature selections, and relevant artifact refs;
- metadata roles and any confounding;
- alternatives considered and the evidence used to compare them;
- the selected result and why it is fit for the question;
- unresolved uncertainty, unsupported claims, and required external validation;
- exported files or external methods that continue the analysis.

Artifact provenance records how Scarf produced a result.
It does not replace this study-level reasoning record.
For an automated run, `AutomatedWorkflowResult.finalAnalysis` provides the exact final artifact
handoff and `reportReferences` identifies the persisted agent reports. The generated local HTML
report is a replaceable presentation of those durable records, not an additional source of truth.
See {doc}`index` for the implemented methods and current boundaries.
