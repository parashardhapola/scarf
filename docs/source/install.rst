Requirements
------------

Python version greater than 3.8.0

Short version
-------------

``pip install scarf-toolkit``

Long version
------------

To use Scarf you need the Python programming language, version 3.8 or upwards, installed.

**Step 1:**

First, check whether you already have Python installed. To do so you need to open a terminal window (aka command prompt).

- On Linux: Pressing key combination ``Ctrl+Alt+T`` together works on most Linux distributions.
- On Windows: Press ``Win+R`` keys on your keyboard. Then, type ``cmd`` and press `Enter`.
- On MacOS: Press ``CMD+Space`` to open spotlight search, and type ``terminal`` and hit `RETURN`.

**Step 2:**

Okay, once you have got a terminal window open, type ``python --version`` and press `ENTER`:

Now you may see one of the following three kinds of output:

- If your output shows you have `Python 3.8.0` or a more recent version. In this case, you are good to go and you can skip Step 3.
- If you have an earlier version than 3.8, for example 3.5 or 2.7, then see step 3.
- If you see an error containing words `not found` or `not recognized` then most likely you do not have a Python version installed on your system. Move to step 3.

**Step 3:**

To install the latest version of Python, we suggest using Miniconda. Download appropriate version based on your operating system from here:
https://conda.io/miniconda.html (version Python 3.8 or above).

If you are confused about 64-bit or 32-bit see this nice `post <https://www.techsoup.org/support/articles-and-how-tos/do-i-need-the-32bit-or-64bit>`_. 
Once you have downloaded Miniconda please follow their instructions `here <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation>`_ to install it.
Once installed, please confirm that you now have a Python version greater than 3.8.0 by typing ``python --version`` in your terminal.

**Step 4:**

Now, in your terminal, type this to install the latest version of Scarf:
``pip install scarf-toolkit``
