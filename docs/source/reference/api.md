# API reference

Public Scarf surfaces for analysts:

- `DataStore` and its documented methods
- Graph-construction methods and `ds.pipeline.run`
- `ArtifactRef`, `ArtifactStatus`, `PipelineRun`, and strict artifact-resolution errors
- `EnrichmentResult` and `read_gmt` for gene-set scoring
- Readers that ingest source formats; writers that create or export Zarr stores (and other exports)
- `scarf.plotting`
- Documented integration metrics (`DataStore.metric_*`; `scarf.metrics` holds the underlying functions)
- `MappingReference` / `MappingResult` for atlas-style mapping
- `scarf.agent.analyze_rna` and its completed result, with the optional agent dependency

Inheritance helpers (`BaseDataStore`, `GraphDataStore`, `MappingDatastore`) are listed under {doc}`api/datastore` for completeness.
Prefer calling methods on `DataStore`.
