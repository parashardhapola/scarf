# Single Cell Crash Course

This course attempts to give you gives you the rough contextual background behind single-cell RNA-seq analysis before you apply yourself.

A quick note on some general vocabulary used here : a *barcode* is one row of the matrix and usually means one droplet and (usually) one cell. A *feature* is one column: a gene, peak, or protein tag. *Active* means selected for analysis. A *result* means a named, stored output with a record of what producedit. See {doc}`reference/glossary` for the full definitions.



## Section 1 — Bulk RNA-seq of a Tissue is a mixtures; Single-cell keeps the distribution of each cell 

Bulk RNA-seq typically functions by grinding up an entire tissue, and reporting the average expression of genes in the sample.
The caveat is if one rare cell type turns a gene on completely while everything else stays silent, the average barely moves
and you miss it in Bulk RNA-seq. Single-cell RNA-seq attempts to solve this by isolating cells into droplets, then tagging each cell's
molecules with a barcode, sequence everything, and counts molecules per cell per gene. For example, say you have 2
T cells that have 12 copies of `CD3D` each, and1 B cell at 0; In bulk, this would result to an average of 8 'CD3D' counts; Instead, single-cell
reports `[12, 12, 0]`, the same average but with specificty now. 

The 5K PBMC dataset in {ref}`Quick start <quickstart>` holds monocytes, B cells, and several T-cell
states no that can't be identified through Bulk RNA-seq. 

In Scarf, everything downstream starts from count matrices of cells and genes, imported with a `*Reader` plus `*ToZarr` writer (see {doc}`tutorials/import_and_export`);
Once you open a store for scarf, the entire analysis can be performed, giving you one item to inspect

```python
ds = scarf.DataStore("scarf_datasets/tenx_5K_pbmc_rnaseq/data.zarr")  # from quickstart
print(ds.RNA.rawData.shape)  # (cells, genes): rows are barcodes, columns are genes
```

However it is important to consider that most single-cell distributions are sparse: many zeros of mixed origin, 
true silence plus missed capture, with a few high values, so ensure that you keep this in mind while analyzing.


## Section 2 — From droplets to a count matrix, and what each count generally means

During the wet lab process of single cell transcriptomics, cells are often isolated into droplets with barcoded beads, broken open so mRNA binds the bead, and then
reverse-transcribed and amplified with the barcode attached (Done via rt-qPCR). 
Following these steps, the droplets are then sequenced and counted per gene-barcode combination. 
Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) tag individual molecules so PCR duplicates collapse to one count: without them, a molecule copied a thousand times would
outshout a thousand distinct molecules copied once each, and amplification noise would pose
as biology. 

Take droplet `T1` for example, which yields the read `T1-CD3D` 12 total times. In our datastore, this becomes row `T1` reading `CD3D:
12` (Gene CD3D has 12 counts). At scale this is thousands of rows by ~20K genes, over 90 percent of these rows are zeros:

```python
reader = scarf.CrH5Reader("counts.h5")  # inspect first: reader.nCells, reader.nFeatures
scarf.CrToZarr(reader, zarr_loc="data.zarr").dump()
ds = scarf.DataStore("data.zarr")  # counts now stream from disk, never fully loaded
```

It is important to note that a count is a sampled molecules, not absolute truth. Twelve counts means 12 repeated captures.
On the other hand, zero CAN BE ambiguous: silence, or a few molecules that missed capture. 
Counts also scale with depth, meaning that sequencing with twice as much depth can increase every count with zero *actual* biological change
Good practice can be considered to plot a histogram of total counts per barcode (cell ). 

```python
ds.cells.to_pandas_dataframe(
    columns=["RNA_nCounts", "RNA_nFeatures", "RNA_percentMito"]
).describe().loc[["min", "50%", "max"]]
```


## Section 3 — Technical variation can appear as true biology unless proved otherwise

Take the following thought experiment for example: 
Say you have 2 perfectly identical cells, and you sequence them with the same machine, same conditions, yet your final product has 2 different count vectors.

Capture efficiency, sequencing depth, ambient soup from burst cells, doublets sharing a barcode, batch shifts across day
or lane, and flickering sparsity all move and influence counts without touching the actual biology, and each can
impersonate an entirely different cell type during analysis. 
Regardless, with advancements in sequencing technology, these large differences occur less often and its important not to fearmonger over them, but rather be aware of what may be driving deviation in your data.

Consider how easily technical noise mimics real biology. Double T1's sequencing depth relative to T2, and its entire expression profile doubles with absolutely nothing changed in the cell. Drop ambient LYZ at a mere 1 to 2 counts into the mix, and even silent cells seem to whisper it. Real, uncorrected batches will separate slightly on a plot, and burst red blood cells will haunt clean lymphocytes with ghost counts of HBB.

To rule our issues in your analysis, always quantify depth, detected genes, and mitochondrial share per cell. You can do this by coloring embedding by sequencing depth to get a visual depicition of the data.

```python
ds.plots.embedding(layout=analysis_run["umap"], color_by="RNA_nCounts")
ds.plots.embedding(layout=analysis_run["umap"], color_by="RNA_clusters")  # the claim, then the check
```

A difference is biological when it aligns with known markers, replicates, and diverse batches. It is technical when it tracks strictly with depth or processing artifact. 

For instance, *MKI67* reads 0 in 99.4% of this dataset's 5,025 cells and a handful of counts in just 28, nearly two-thirds of them *CD3D*+ T cells: sparse, marker-consistent, a cycling state worth pursuing rather than noise.

Conversely, monocytes here total nearly double the rest, a median near 14,800 counts against roughly 7,500, on the back of *LYZ* averaging 50 with cells past 900 plus *S100A9* and *S100A8*: normalize before admiring any monocyte "upregulation." Splits that replicate across datasets and donors are biology. Splits that live exclusively in one lane are suspects.
A cluster whose markers are entirely ribosomal, *RPS27* sits in 96.8% of cells at a mean near 68, and derived from a single sample has already told you what it actually is.
Read the same three facts through the store instead of taking them asserted. The feature
table carries per-gene detection counts, and one gene column at a time streams out of the
count array:

```python
import numpy as np

feats = ds.RNA.feats.to_pandas_dataframe(columns=["names", "nCells"]).set_index("names")
print(feats.loc[["MKI67", "RPS27"]])  # 28 vs 4864 cells: sparsity vs ubiquity, one table

order = list(ds.RNA.feats.fetch_all("names"))
def gene(name):
    i = order.index(name)
    return np.asarray(ds.RNA.rawData[:, i:i + 1].compute()).ravel()  # slice, not scalar

mki, cd3 = gene("MKI67"), gene("CD3D")
print("MKI67+:", int((mki > 0).sum()), "of which CD3D+:", int(((mki > 0) & (cd3 > 0)).sum()))

nc = ds.cells.fetch_all("RNA_nCounts")
mono = gene("LYZ") >= np.percentile(gene("LYZ"), 90)
print("monocyte median vs rest:", np.median(nc[mono]), np.median(nc[~mono]))
```
Make this ordering an analytical reflex: depth and batch colorings first, cluster interpretation second, every single time. A grouping checked against confounders late is a grouping already falsely believed.


## Section 4 — Quality control is often the most significant part of your analysis

Filtering out cells during quality control (qc) is the most critical part of the analysis.
All of the work done during transcriptomics analysis depends on QC, as it aids in distinguishing between technical artificats versus true biological significant (see above).
Generally, cells with near-zero counts go, damaged cells with few genes and high mitochondrial share go, and doublets wait because they are a different problem than low quality.
Modern filtering marks rows rather than deleting them (which other softwares do!), thus thresholds stay inspectable and reversible, and cutoffs come from the tails of your own distributions, never another tissue's numbers. This allows you to try multiple different thresholds to see what fits your data the best.

Generally, work done with PBMCs  filters roughly 1000–15000 counts, 500–4000 genes, mito under 15 percent, then shows violins before and after, and those numbers are PBMC-specific. Filtering returns an immutable selection artifact and leaves live metadata untouched. This is a general guideline and potential starting point, remember, do what fits your data the best.


```python
qc_sel = ds.filter_cells(attrs=["RNA_nCounts", "RNA_nFeatures", "RNA_percentMito"],
                         lows=[1000, 500, 0], highs=[15000, 4000, 15])
# qc_sel is a cell_selection artifact: inspectable, reusable, and never a deletion.
```

Doublets instead can be addressed in 2 ways, either by removing them before the downstream analysis occurs, or marking doublets, keeping them in your final embeddings, and during visualization, then potentially remove them. Both paths share one first step that removes nothing: scoring runs after clustering, against the clustered graph, and returns an artifact of per-cell scores:

```python
doublet_run = ds.pipeline.run(..., doublets=True)  # abbreviated; see quality_control tutorial
doublets = doublet_run["doublets"]  # score artifact, not a deletion
scores = np.asarray(doublet_run.cells.fetch("doublet_score"))
pd.Series(scores, name="doublet_score").plot(kind="hist", bins=40)  # read the tail first
```

Path 2 keeps them in and looks first. Color the embedding by score and read where the
doublets live: bridges and fringes lighting up together means doublets form their own
crowd, while scattered sparks across clusters means random collisions:

```python
ds.plots.embedding(run=doublet_run, color_by="doublet_score", sort_values=True)
```

Path 1 removes by threshold once the histogram and the embedding agree. The teaching cutoff
below takes the upper 5 percent; set yours from your own tail shape, then compose the bound
with the score artifact's stored selection:

```python
cut = float(pd.Series(scores).quantile(0.95))  # teaching cutoff, not a constant
clean = ds.select_cells(doublets, high=cut, keep_bounds=True)  # downstream uses clean
```


## Section 5 — Normalization allows you compare cells; Feature Selection lets you put different lenses on

Cells sequenced at different depths cannot have their gene expression counts compared. Scaling each profile to a common
size factor and log-transforming tames the skew so a unit of difference reads roughly as
fold-change. `Mono1` totals 50 against `B1`'s 27, and raw `GAPDH` of 10 versus 7 suggests a
difference that scaling dissolves, while `CD14` stays Mono1-specific because that
difference was real. Normalized values are more comparible values:

```python
sel = ds.snapshot_cell_selection("I")
norm = ds.run_normalization(sel, analysis_run["highly_variable_features"])
```

Most genes are uninformative: silent or constant everywhere, or pure noise. A few hundred
to a few thousand vary in ways that track identity, and highly variable gene selection models the
mean-variance trend to keep genes varying beyond expectation for their abundance. Each
default exclusion earns its place: mitochondrial patterns track damage and leakage,
ribosomal ones track depth and translational bustle, cell-cycle genes would cluster phases
instead of types, HLA patterns track donor rather than tissue biology, histones ride
technical correlated programs, and sex-linked genes split donors instead of cell states.
Across our list: `CD3D`, `MS4A1`, `CD14`, and `LYZ` stay, flat `GAPDH` goes,
damage-tracking `MT-CO1` is ruled out:

```python
hvg = ds.select_hvgs(sel, top_n=500)
ds.inspect_artifact(hvg).parameters  # what exactly defines this gene set
```

The selected set is a simple lens: change it and the atlas can change, which is expected as we choose a different set to analyze.


## Section 6 — Principal Component Analysis shrinks the data down, graphs link similar cells, and UMAP draws the map.

Genes often move together in programs, so the true number of dimensions is far below the
gene count. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) finds the main axes of variation, ranked by how much variance each explains. This allows us to simplify from higher dimensional data, and get the 2d/3d representations of the data.
Usually, you can use an elbow plot to know where to cut off your data.

```python
pca = ds.run_pca(norm, dims=15, show_elbow_plot=True)
ds.inspect_artifact(pca).parameters  # name each kept axis before using it
```

If you wanna get a little more in depth, in the PCA space, we get each cell's k nearest neighbors by putting them on a weighted graph based on what we get from PCA. 
not the matrix, is what embeddings, clusters, trajectories, and imputation all use. 

```python
index = ds.build_ann_index(pca)
neighbors = ds.query_neighbors(index, k=11)
graph = ds.build_connectivity_map(neighbors)  # everything downstream consumes this
```

Most of the plots you see in recent publications use the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)method to plot the data in 2 dimensions.

Essentially, all UMAP does it from the PCA space, it places cells so graph neighbors stay close.
Nearby placements indicate cells similiar to one another, with distances between 'islands'  showing that one group of cells is different from another. The empty spaces and distances are not measurements. When you select a seed, all it does  reshape the drawing without touching the graph. The graph always stays the same, but the way we can project our data differs!  

```python
init = ds.build_embedding_initialization(pca)
umap = ds.run_umap(graph, init)  # coordinates only; the graph holds the biology
```

See the difference on the same cells, colored identically. PCA shows axes of variation,
UMAP shows neighborhoods and a 2d representations of the cells. Plot the recomputed
layout the Scarf way, colored by the run's own clusters:

```python
analysis_run = ds.pipeline.open(label="docs_default")  # named run, reused in later sections
ds.plots.embedding(layout=umap, color_by=analysis_run["clusters"])  # same cells, same colors
```

No biological pattern will depend on the seed or parameters you use. All this does it tune how you see the picture!


## Section 7 — Clustering finds groups, markers name them, and doublets get removed

Community detection cuts the graph where edges run sparse, so dense pockets become
clusters. 

Resolution sets how fine the groups are, with higher values giving you more communities and groups. 
You can use hierarchical Paris clustering as well to get a second view of the same graph with its own flavor. There is no single best resoluton, only the resolution that best allows you to represent your data based on what you same expect

```python
leiden = ds.run_leiden_clustering(graph, resolution=0.5)
paris = ds.run_paris_clustering(graph)  # hierarchical second view, same graph
```

Stable blocks across methods and resolutions are populations. Flickering boundaries could be hypothesis to investigate. Extra high-resolution clusters are not new types until proven, and may just be part of a larger population.

To identify the identity of the cluster/community, you can rank genes and identify potential "marker genes" that represent the cell's identity. You can then visualize the spatial orientation of these certain genes on your UMAP to identify what communities may correspond to what cell identity.

```python
labels = analysis_run.cells.fetch("clusters")
top = ds.get_markers(marker=analysis_run["markers"], group_id=labels[0],
                     min_score=0.1, min_frac_exp=0.1)  # positives AND negatives both matter
```


## Section 8 — Testing differences, counting cells, and proving things with replicates.

Groupwise tests rank candidates with correction across the gene family. It is important
to note that with thousands of cells, even tiny shifts go significant, so read effect
size and overlap first and p-values second. Take the simplest case to start: one gene &
two conditions. Say you want to know if ISG15 differs between control and stimulated
cells. Group the cells by sample_id and run a Welch's t-test, which stays descriptive at
the cell level.

```python
from scarf.plotting import CellField, StudyDesign
analysis_run = ds.pipeline.open(label="docs_default")  # named run reused through this section
res = ds.run_statistical_testing("ISG15", grouping=CellField("sample_id"), test="welch")
# Effect first: mean_1, mean_2, mean_difference in res.tables["ISG15"]. p second.
```

For example, say your study design has donors measured in both conditions. 
First begin by setting your basic rules, such as what statistical test are you running, what correction methods are you using, and how are you doing to do it. After that, denote the information in your Study Design, like the donor_id or the disease status

```python
design = StudyDesign(sample_by="donor_id", condition_by="disease", pair_by="pair_index")
```

Cell type composition is a different question entirely, one that can be particulary insightful, and it lives at the sample level, not the cell level. Usually, you tally proportions per independent sample directly from raw metadata, which can avoid issues like pseudoreplication.

```python
tally = ds.cells.to_pandas_dataframe(columns=["sample_id"])
tally["cluster"] = analysis_run.cells.fetch("clusters")
tally.groupby(["sample_id", "cluster"]).size()  # per-sample, never pooled
```

Condition claims with proper replicates often need one more step to point out key differences/changes. This is where we can aggregate counts within each cekk-type into bulk-like profiles to replicate the bulk-RNAseq modality. We can do this because summing the counts for our genes often yields a distribution that we would observe in bulk data for that sample. This downside of this is trading resolution for valid inference of our hypothesis. Regardless, we still get a good degree of resolution from bulking specific cell types of interest

```python
bulk = ds.make_bulk(groups=analysis_run["clusters"], aggr_type="sum")
# bulk rows are replicates now: export to DESeq2/edgeR, not a cell-level test.
```

Resist the pseudo-replicate shortcut. Randomly splitting one donor's cells into groups
produces resamples of the same cells, not independent replicates. Testing them as
replicates is pseudoreplication wearing a lab coat. Aggregate within type, never across
the whole mixture, or the rare signal dissolves into the average it was meant to escape.
Name the N, the denominator, and the family before running anything. Remember, do what
fits the question being asked: cells answer cell-level questions, and donors answer
condition-level ones.


## Section 9 — Gene programs, cell states, cell talk, and journeys through time.

Genes act in teams. Scoring a set per cell turns noisy flickers into one activity number:
the team can read confidently up while each player stays borderline. Score T activation
and `T1` with `T2` run high even where members read 0, because the rank pattern holds,
while `B1` stays low despite sharing `GAPDH`. Cite the set definition, the overlap with
measured genes, and member spot checks, never the score alone:

```python
act = ds.run_aucell(net, sel, features=universe)  # net: gene-set table, universe: all_features ref
# Then spot-check members: the team claim needs at least some players visible.
```

A program sharing 90 percent of its genes with cell cycle is measuring cell cycle. A
five-gene set with four unmeasured genes measures nothing. Know which scorer you ran.
AUCell walks down each cell's ranked genes and measures how fast set members accumulate,
so it asks about rank recovery and tolerates dropout. WAGGR takes a weighted average over
the set, so it asks about magnitude and leans on detected values. Different questions,
different sensitivities, same duty to check members. See
{doc}`tutorials/gene_set_scoring` for the full call. Name the scorer, the overlap, and
one surviving member before believing any program.


States are graded overlays on discrete identity. Score them as numbers per cell rather
than forcing new clusters: a proliferating T cell stays a T cell with a high cycle score.
`T2`'s `MKI67` against `T1`'s zero is same identity, different state, so score both and
cluster neither apart; see {doc}`tutorials/cell_cycle`. Splitting G2M off as a novel type
is one error. Regressing cycle out when cycle is the biology is the other.

Cell-cell communication matches ligands in candidate senders against receptors in receivers
from prior databases. Every arrow is opportunity, not proof. Dissociated co-expression
cannot show contact, direction, or causation. `Mono1`'s ligand against T-cell receptors
proposes Mono-to-T talk without saying they ever neighbored. Scarf stops at export by
design:

```python
adata = ds.to_anndata()  # active cells with labels; CCC runs externally from here
```

Write "consistent with signaling" with the missing evidence named in the same sentence.
Keep pairs whose receptor appears in 2 percent of receivers out of the main figure unless
a rule puts them there.

Trajectories order cells along a continuum where biology moves them along a path. The
graph stretches into a trail and pseudotime walks it from a declared start. Sources and
sinks supervise the orientation. No method discovers termini from nothing, and reversing
the declared source reverses the "trajectory" while the data never changes. Real pancreas
work orders progenitors toward alpha, beta, and delta fates from supplied termini with
validity keys; the full arc is {doc}`tutorials/pseudotime`,
{doc}`tutorials/expression_dynamics`, {doc}`tutorials/fate_mapping`, and
{doc}`tutorials/trajectory_validation`. Demand all four validity readings before
believing: connected graph components along the path, markers trending monotonically,
coherent modules along the axis, and fate probabilities that stay valid instead of leaking
everywhere. Every trajectory sentence carries its supervision. Pseudotime tracking total
counts is a depth gradient until two graph-level checks say otherwise. Components,
trends, modules, validity keys, or no trajectory sentence.

## Section 10 — Batch effects, replicates, and knowing when to trust your results.

Batches shift measurements globally, and correction pulls them together while trying to
preserve type structure. Under-correction leaves batch clusters. Over-correction erases
real biology. Correcting a variable confounded with condition deletes the finding while
claiming to preserve it. Our cast sequenced across two days at 20 percent offset needs day
correction to realign. With all T cells on day one and all B on day two, no method
separates type from day and the honest answer is a new experiment. Correct, then diagnose
mixing gained against structure kept, never one score alone:

```python
fixed = ds.run_harmony(analysis_run["pca"], batch_columns=["batch"])
# Harmony corrects reduced coordinates between PCA and neighbor search, where the graph is built.
# Compare uncorrected vs corrected graphs on mixing AND structure kept. Never one score.
```

Harmony edits coordinates, not counts, and it edits them blind. With no batch term for a
confounded design there is nothing innocent to remove, so check the uncorrected baseline
first and keep it in the figure. Rankings should survive new data, new seeds, and one
held-out diagnostic nobody tuned against. Otherwise the benchmark measured tuning effort
instead of methods. Baseline kept, both diagnostics quoted, seeds fixed.


The unit of inference follows the question. Cells answer annotation and ranking. Subjects
and runs answer whether treatment works. Thousands of cells as independent observations
manufacture significance. Neither Welch nor rank tests escape, because the dependence
lives in the design, not the formula. The RA workflow averages within donors and tests 18
matched pairs, refusing 1,386 cells as replicates. Every claim carries its unit, and every
figure that matters shows both Ns:

```python
res = ds.run_statistical_testing("ISG15", grouping=CellField("sample_id"),
                                 test="wilcoxon", sample_by="donor_id",
                                 pair_by="pair_index")  # N is donors now, not cells
```

Findings that need cell N to survive are descriptive and should say so. Labels earn trust
from positives present, negatives absent, reference and method agreement, and replicate
support. Build references once with diagnostics beside every transferred label:

```python
ref = ds.build_mapping_reference(neighbors)  # fixed reference; queries stay comparable
```

Compare methods on fixed data with fixed seeds, one change at a time, judged by several
independent diagnostics. Use `metric_ilisi` for mixing against `metric_graph_connectivity`
for structure kept, letting the pair argue instead of either ruling. Computation proposes
and independent data disposes. Climb from held-out donors through orthogonal assays to
perturbation, with every sentence carrying its rung. Reproducibility is provenance plus
environment plus data identity, written where the next reader trips over it. Lineage
reports turn any headline result into a diagram from counts to claim:

```python
rep = ds.lineage(analysis_run["markers"])
print(rep.to_markdown())  # counts to claim, published beside the figure it supports
```

Nearly every disaster is one of ten familiar confusions: soup called cells, doublets
called types, depth called biology, batch called condition, resolution called discovery,
means called distributions, cells called subjects, correlation called circuit, layout
distances called measurements, and parameters called defaults-that-must-be-right. Tape the
two honesty colorings, total counts and batch, to every embedding forever. Add one
crosstab per clustering decision, and prosecute each presentable figure under all ten
headings. Finish by posing one narrow question on the 5K PBMC data with its population,
comparison, unit of inference, and kill criterion stated before any code runs, in three
figures maximum. Ship the strongest objection you could not dismiss alongside the
claim.
