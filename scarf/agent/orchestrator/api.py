    ``source`` is a supported input file or an existing Zarr store. ``assay``
    selects the RNA assay when the input contains more than one. The workflow
    runs unattended and raises ``AnalysisError`` if essential evidence remains
    unresolved or execution fails. A completed result provides ``plot_embedding()``,
    ``get_markers()``, and ``report()``.

    Work is bounded by the advanced orchestrator's screening and full-cohort
    limits. Use that interface for explicit workspaces, execution limits, and
    resumable pauses. An identical repeated call reuses or resumes exact work.

    ``score_doublets=False`` skips advisory doublet scoring when Harmony is
    unavailable or prohibited. Harmony-eligible runs retain the matched doublet
    diagnostics required by the correction acceptance gate. Scoring does not
    remove cells. Changing this option requires a new workflow destination.
    Advisory scoring defaults to disabled for new beginner calls. Pass
    ``score_doublets=True`` explicitly to resume a run that enabled scoring.
